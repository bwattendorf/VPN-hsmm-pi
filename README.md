VPN-hsmm-pi
===========

Configuring VPN for hsmm-pi.

Note this is currently for joining the RI Mesh only. International links are welcome however your VPN connection will be to W1BAW-1.

I am currently only working on the client side scripts at present. Once I am happy with them I will start working on the server side configuration scripts.

HSMM-PI will need to be installed first. 

if you want to resize the image run sudo perl ./resizeimage.pl
and then after burning run   sudo raspi-config first thing to expand the the file system back


If you have any questions please feel free to ask away.
